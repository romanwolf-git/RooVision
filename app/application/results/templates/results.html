<h3 class="mt-2">Class-wise Mean Average Precision</h3>
<div id="plot" style="flex"></div>
<p>Overall, the model demonstrates strong performance in most classes, achieving high precision and recall values. The mAP50 scores range from 0.846 to 0.990, and the mAP50-95 scores range from 0.714 to 0.853. These results suggest that the model is robust in identifying and localising kangaroos and wallabies in images.</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">Training and Validation Metrics</h3>
<img src="{{ url_for('results_bp.static', filename='img/training_results.png') }}"></img>
<p>The above results demonstrate the successful progression of model training. After an initial stabilisation phase of about 25 epochs, key training metrics such as box loss, classification loss and distribution focal loss (DFL) show a gradual but consistent decrease. In particular, within the last 15 epochs of the 300-epoch training period, there is an accelerated reduction in training losses, likely due to the deactivation of mosaic augmentation, a practice commonly used to enhance model stabilisation towards the end of training.</p>
<p>The plots illustrate that training losses decrease at a faster rate than validation losses. Specifically, box and distribution focus losses show slower rates of decline compared to classification losses, indicating that the model requires less time for image classification relative to object localisation within an image.</p>
<p>Analogous to the patterns observed for training and validation losses, the performance metrics reflect an initial stabilisation phase, followed by a steady increase in both precision and recall throughout the training period. In summary, the model shows robust generalisation capabilities without any significant signs of overfitting.</p>
